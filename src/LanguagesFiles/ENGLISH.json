A significant percentage of the earnings will be automatically transferred to your account every 24 hours. You will then have the choice to either withdraw your profits to your preferred wallet or reinvest them to amplify your returns.",

  "how8": "At the top of your homepage, there is a unique referral link assigned to you that you can share with others, enabling them to benefit from our services. When someone signs up using your link, you will receive a gift equal to 10% of any amount they invest. You can either withdraw the gift or choose to invest it for a special offer where the amount is treated as if it were multiplied by 10.For instance, if someone signs up using your link and invests 10,000 USDT, you'll immediately receive a gift of 1,000 USDT. If you choose to invest it, the 1,000 USDT will be treated as if it were 10,000 USDT, allowing you to earn a higher percentage, such as 11% instead of 7.2%.Additionally, you can independently invest in another gift, even if you've already started one. This will create a separate investment with its own set of daily benefits.",
  "how9": "At the top of the page, you will find your VIP link. This link operates differently from the others. When you share it, people will use it to sign up, and then they will share their regular referral link with others to create accounts and make investments. The owner of the regular referral link will receive 10% of the amount invested by these new sign-ups. From this 10%, 10% will be automatically transferred to your gift window. From there, you have the same options as with the other gifts: you can 'Withdraw' the amount to transfer it to your wallet, or 'Invest' it to earn daily profits. If you choose to invest it, we offer a special bonus where the gift amount is treated as if it were multiplied by 10. For instance, if you have a gift of 1,000 USDT and decide to invest it, the 1,000 USDT will be treated as if it were 10,000 USDT.
